# MS Northwind for Oracle #

## Summary ##
Ever wanted or had the need to create a version of the MS Northwind SQL Server Database on Oracle?  If you are working with EntLib code base and want to run the unit tests then you know what I'm taking about.  The scrips below will create Northwind in an Oracle database.

### Scripts: ( order required to be run ) ###
1. northwind.oracle.schema.sql
2. northwind.oracle.tables.views..sql
3. northwind.oracle.packages.sql
4. northwind.oracle.sps.sql
5. northwind.oracle.seed.sql
6. northwind.oracle.constraints.sql

If you want to be able to export and import once created instead of running scripts use.
* export.oracle.northwind.cmd
* import.oracle.northwind.cmd
